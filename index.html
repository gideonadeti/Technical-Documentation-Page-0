            <h2>Introduction to Python</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that has gained widespread popularity for
                    its simplicity, readability, and flexibility.
                    Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python was designed with an emphasis on code
                    readability, allowing developers to express
                    concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java. Its syntax is clean and easy to
                    understand, making it an ideal choice for beginners
                    and experienced developers alike. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                    procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming,
                    making it adaptable to various application domains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of Python's key strengths lies in its extensive standard library, which provides a rich set of
                    modules and packages, enabling developers to
                    accomplish a wide range of tasks without having to write code from scratch. This ecosystem of
                    pre-built tools and utilities enhances productivity
                    and accelerates the development process. Python's cross-platform compatibility further contributes
                    to its popularity, allowing developers to write
                    code that can run seamlessly on different operating systems without modification. As a result,
                    Python has become a go-to language for a diverse
                    range of applications, from web development and data science to artificial intelligence and
                    automation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Python community plays a vital role in the language's success, fostering a collaborative and
                    supportive environment. The availability of
                    numerous third-party libraries and frameworks, such as Django for web development, NumPy for
                    scientific computing, and TensorFlow for machine learning,
                    underscores the vibrant ecosystem that has evolved around Python. With its widespread adoption in
                    industry and academia, Python continues to be a

                    <code>
        def greet_me(your_name):
            print("Hello " + your_name)
        
        greet_me("World")
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>

            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    In Python, variables are used to store and manage data. Unlike some other programming languages,
                    Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a
                    variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create a variable, you simply assign a value to it using the equal sign (=). Here's an example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    # Creating variables
    name = "John"
    age = 25
    is_student = True
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In the example above, we've created three variables: <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and
                    <code>is_student</code>.
                    The variable <code>name</code> stores a string, <code>age</code> stores an integer, and
                    <code>is_student</code> stores a boolean value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Variables can be used in various operations and are fundamental to performing tasks and storing
                    information in Python programs.

            <h2>Data Types</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Python supports several built-in data types that allow you to represent different kinds of values in
                    your programs.
                    Here are some common data types in Python:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Integers:</strong> Whole numbers without a fractional component. Example:
                        <code>42</code>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Floats:</strong> Numbers that have a decimal point or are represented in scientific
                        notation. Example: <code>3.14</code></li>
                    <li><strong>Strings:</strong> Sequences of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes. Example:
                        <code>"Hello, Python!"</code>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Booleans:</strong> Represents the truth values <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Lists:</strong> Ordered and mutable sequences of elements. Example:
                        <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Tuples:</strong> Ordered and immutable sequences of elements. Example:
                        <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Dictionaries:</strong> Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Example:
                        <code>{"key": "value"}</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Python's dynamic typing allows variables to change their data type during runtime.
                    You can perform operations and manipulate data based on these data types to achieve various tasks in
                    your programs.

            <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Conditional statements allow your Python program to make decisions and execute different code blocks
                    based on specified conditions.
                    The main types of conditional statements in Python are <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code> (else if),
                    and <code>else</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's a simple example using an <code>if</code> statement:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    # Example using if statement
    age = 18
    
    if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In the example above, the program checks whether the variable <code>age</code> is greater than or
                    equal to 18.
                    If the condition is true, it executes the code block under the <code>if</code> statement; otherwise,
                    it executes the code block under <code>else</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use <code>elif</code> for additional conditions between <code>if</code> and
                    <code>else</code> if needed.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    # Example using if, elif, and else statements
    score = 75
    
    if score >= 90:
        print("Excellent!")
    elif score >= 70:
        print("Good job!")
    else:
        print("Try again next time.")
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Conditional statements are essential for creating dynamic and responsive programs that can adapt to
                    different situations.

            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Loops in Python allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. One common type of loop is the
                    <code>while</code> loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>while</code> loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true. Here's a
                    simple example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    # Example using while loop
    count = 0
    
    while count < 5:
        print("Count:", count)
        count += 1
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    In the example above, the <code>while</code> loop prints the value of <code>count</code> as long as
                    it is less than 5.
                    The loop continues to execute until the condition becomes false.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another type of loop is the <code>for</code> loop, which iterates over a sequence (such as a list or
                    string).
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    # Example using for loop
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    for num in numbers:
        print("Number:", num)
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    The <code>for</code> loop in this example iterates over the list of numbers and prints each number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loops are powerful tools for automating repetitive tasks and processing sequences of data.
